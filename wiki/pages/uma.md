# UMA

(Todo: Finish this section)

Hi! UMA is an asset for Unity and it has lots of cool character related uses. We might use it, or we might borrow some concepts and implement them ourselves. Time will tell!

## Utility Recipes I recommend (+downloads)

Downloads: 5/11/2021: I stored these on the VReps drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1izohXZgLnXj70TLEaYv4ejM3RVPldbaf?usp=sharing). If that link no longer works, I found these in the UMA 2 asset store download.They also have a GitHub repo, which removes the need for the asset store download.

### How to add a recipe
- Navigate to the game object with the Dynamic Character Avatar Script
- Under "Additional Utility Recipes," drag in your recipe of choice.
- Press play to apply

### Distorted wrist fix (Forearm twist)
- Go to [this timestamp](https://youtu.be/9ii5tsOwx1w?t=481) to hear Secret Anorak explain why this is good. But basically, UMA generally messes up the forearm and causes distortions in the wrist. So this utility asset will help fix that.

### Jaw hanging open fix
- Workaround to make UMA characters close their mouths for most animations
