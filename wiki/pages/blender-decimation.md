## Decimate without losing shape keys?

Blender will give you hassle if you try to apply a modifier to an object that has shape keys. So don't even use a modifier for this!

There's a tool right in edit mode called "decimate geometry." Be sure to create a backup before using this, since it is destructive. Then make sure that your shape keys have been preserved and still look good.
